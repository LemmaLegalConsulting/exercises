# Environment Setup

Make sure you have Python already installed on your local machine. If you're using VS Code to go into a Terminal and create a virtual environment:

`python -m venv .venv`

Once it creates the folder activate the environment:

Windows: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate` 
*nix/MacOS: `source .venv/bin/activate`

Make sure that __pytest__ is installed:

`pip install pytest`
